# Chromium-Browsers-Pass-Decryptor
The application that decrypts saved passwords for Chromium-based web browsers using 2 files.

You need to steal your victim's local state and login data files.
For example, after stealing files like "C:\Users{USERNAME}\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Local State" and "C:\Users{USERNAME}\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data," simply input the path into the application. It's that simple.
